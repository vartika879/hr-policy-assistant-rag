"""
Step 9: evaluate answer quality against a fixed set 
of test questions.

Unlike tracing (which just records what happened), 
evaluation runs the
agent against a known set of question/reference-answer 
pairs and scores
each answer using a second LLM as a judge.
Results are uploaded to
LangSmith as a Dataset + Experiment, 
so quality can be compared across
runs (after a prompt change, a new model, a new guardrail, etc).

The judge model is routed through Portkey too,
using the same slug as
the main app's LLM (gateway.py's PRIMARY_PROVIDER) 
but a different
underlying model (JUDGE_MODEL_NAME) - 
so it isn't grading its own
output verbatim, without needing a second slug set up.
